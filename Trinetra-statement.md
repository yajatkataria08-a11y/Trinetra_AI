# Problem Statement

India is witnessing an unprecedented rise in digital content creation. Millions of independent creators, regional media houses, MSMEs, educators, and startups publish images, videos, and audio content daily across social media platforms, OTT services, news portals, and e-commerce channels.

Despite this growth, **copyright protection remains largely inaccessible** to most creators in Bharat.

## Existing Challenges

Most existing copyright detection and IP protection systems suffer from one or more of the following limitations:

- High cost and enterprise-only pricing models
- Dependence on cloud-based proprietary APIs
- Poor support for offline or low-bandwidth environments
- Limited transparency in detection decisions
- Lack of tools usable by non-technical users
- Inaccessibility for small creators, MSMEs, and regional publishers

As a result, content theft, unauthorized reuse, and brand dilution are widespread, disproportionately impacting creators and organizations with limited legal or technical resources.

## Why This Matters for Bharat

India’s digital ecosystem is uniquely diverse:
- Content spans multiple languages, regions, and formats
- Many creators operate on low-end hardware and limited internet connectivity
- Legal enforcement is slow, making **early detection** critical

Without affordable and accessible tools, creators are often left defenseless against plagiarism and infringement.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build **Trinetra**, an AI-powered, multimodal copyright detection and IP defense system that:

- Enables secure registration of original content
- Detects potential copyright infringement in images, videos, and audio
- Works in offline or low-connectivity environments after setup
- Avoids reliance on paid third-party APIs
- Provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users

## Proposed Solution

Trinetra leverages modern AI models and efficient similarity search techniques to compare suspicious media against a protected registry of original assets. By using semantic embeddings instead of simple hashing, the system remains robust to common transformations such as resizing, cropping, compression, and partial reuse.

The solution prioritizes **accessibility, affordability, and scalability**, making it suitable for deployment across Bharat’s rapidly expanding digital economy.

## Expected Impact

By democratizing access to copyright detection technology, Trinetra aims to:

- Empower independent creators and artists
- Protect MSME brand assets and media
- Support regional publishers and news organizations
- Reduce content theft through early detection
- Promote ethical content reuse in India’s digital ecosystem
